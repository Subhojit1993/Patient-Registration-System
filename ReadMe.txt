The task is completed fully with having some validations.

I completed as much as I could till now.

At first, Place the folder I have sent, named- PatientRegister to C:/xampp/htdocs/

Open the XAMPP Control Panel. (If you don't have xampp kindly download & then install it)

Start the Apache & MySQL in XAMPP Control Panel.

Then click on the database folder (that is in the file named PatientRegister sent by me) & import patient_reg.sql (given in the folder, named- database) into localhost/phpmyadmin/

After that, open your browser and run the link localhost/PatientRegister/patient_register.php on your web browser.

Thank You.
